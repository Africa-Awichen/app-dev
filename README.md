*Metro 2033 by Dmitry Glukhovsky is a fictional dystopian world set within the the Moscow Metro tunnels, where the last survivors of humanity hide after a global nuclear holocaust. Eventually, communities settled within the underground train stations and developed into independent states over time. The novel follows a 24-year-old man named Artyom, who must save his home station from the dangers, human and mutant enemies, lurking within the Metro.*

As a certified bookworm, there are three main reasons why this series stands out for me, compared to other dystopian fictional series:

### 1. Rich World-Building and Immersive Atmosphere
The setting of the Moscow Metro system is vividly described with it's dark and claustrophobic tunnels lurking underneath, the remnants of a devastated and radioactive world up the surface, and the survivors' struggles to maintain a semblance of civilization create a sense of isolation and foreboding hopelessness that permeates the story.
> *"The tunnels of the metro were not silent. They never had been. But now they were full of whispers. The darkness, the cold, the dead — it was a horrible place, where even the echoes seemed to get lost, to never return."*
### 2. Philosophical and Existential Themes
Although the series is mostly despair-inducing horror, it also delves into profound philosophical questions about survival, the nature of humanity, and the meaning of life in a post-apocalyptic world. Each character grapple with difficult choices that question their moral values and the innate instinct to survive at any cost, shedding light on human frailty in a broken world.
> *The dark is dangerous. But the light? The light is no less dangerous. People are weak. They burn out in the light, just like moths. And if they don't burn out, they become blinded by it."
### 3. Strong and Developed Protagonist
The protagonist, Artyom, is not just a typical hero but a flawed, deeply human character whose development is integral to the novel's impact. His journey from an inexperienced young man to someone who must take on unimaginable responsibilities is compelling and relatable. His personal growth mirrors the harsh realities of the world he inhabits. Artyom’s internal conflict and struggle with fear and duty make him a realistic and sympathetic figure, and his growth over the course of the novel is one of the core emotional drivers of the story.
> *"I was not a hero, not a leader of men. I was only a simple man with simple desires and fears. I had no idea what I was doing. But I did it."

Overall, these three main elements are what makes Metro 2033 my favorite series of all time!
